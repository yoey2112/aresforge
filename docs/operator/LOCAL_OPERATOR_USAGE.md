# Local Operator Usage

## Core Validation Bundle (M17 for #270/#271/#272)

- `git diff --check`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-repo-governance`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-state --parent-issue <parent>`
- `python -m aresforge plan-milestone-execution-queue --parent-issue <parent>`

## Milestone Inspection (M17 #271)

Commands:

- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-state --parent-issue <parent>`

Behavior:

- read-only issue and milestone state inspection
- parent/child discovery from detectable references
- child state, lineage, and merged PR evidence hints summary
- no issue closure
- no PR creation
- no comments
- no GitHub edits

## Milestone Queue Planning (M17 #272)

Commands:

- `python -m aresforge plan-milestone-execution-queue --parent-issue <parent>`

Behavior:

- planning-only milestone child execution ordering
- deterministic child sequencing with final reconciliation issue last when detected
- blocker and missing lineage surfacing
- missing merged PR evidence signal surfacing
- explicit safety gates:
  - execution enabled false
  - close issues false
  - bulk closeout allowed false
  - operator review required true
- no issue closure
- no PR creation
- no comments
- no GitHub edits

## Controlled Autonomous Execution (M16)

Commands:

- `python -m aresforge run-autonomous-cycle --mode dry-run --parent-issue <parent> --target-issue <target>`
- `python -m aresforge run-autonomous-cycle --mode local-write --parent-issue <parent> --target-issue <target>`
- `python -m aresforge run-autonomous-cycle --mode branch-write --parent-issue <parent> --target-issue <target> --branch-name <branch> --commit-message <message>`
- `python -m aresforge run-autonomous-cycle --mode push-pr --parent-issue <parent> --target-issue <target> --branch-name <branch> --commit-message <message> --pr-title <title>`
- `python -m aresforge run-autonomous-cycle --mode closeout-eligible --parent-issue <parent> --target-issue <target> --branch-name <branch> --commit-message <message> --pr-title <title>`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-autonomous-run --run-id <id>`

Mode behavior:

- `dry-run`: read-only plan and validation path; no repository or GitHub mutation.
- `local-write`: local lifecycle progression with evidence generation; no GitHub mutation.
- `branch-write`: enables branch and commit mutation only after gate pass.
- `push-pr`: enables branch/commit plus push and PR creation after gate pass.
- `closeout-eligible`: enables push-pr path plus controlled issue closure after closeout gates pass.

## Fail-Closed Gate Design

Higher-permission modes require explicit inputs and fail closed when missing:

- `branch-write`: requires `--branch-name` and `--commit-message`
- `push-pr`: requires branch-write inputs plus `--pr-title`
- `closeout-eligible`: requires push-pr inputs plus validation pass, issue-PR linkage (`pr_number` + `pr_url`), and merged-PR evidence pass

## Evidence And Audit

- Every run writes evidence artifacts under `artifacts/evidence/generated`.
- Every mutation/evaluation step is recorded in DB-backed `run_steps`.
- Run lifecycle state is recorded in `autonomous_runs`.
- Failed runs still produce evidence and persisted step history.

## Human-Gated Mutation Boundaries

Allowed:

- human-triggered command execution
- explicit mode-scoped mutation
- evidence-backed run inspection

Not authorized:

- mutation in `dry-run`
- GitHub mutation in `local-write` or `branch-write`
- push/PR outside explicit higher-permission modes
- issue closure outside explicit `closeout-eligible`
- automatic PR merge
- background jobs, polling loops, or schedulers

## Governance Note

- `inspect-repo-governance` milestone naming warning may remain non-blocking (`milestone_naming_status.naming_ok: false`).
