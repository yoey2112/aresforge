# AresForge Roadmap

## Current Milestones

### M0-M20

Status: Completed.

### M21 - Self-Managed Milestone Execution Loop

Status: Completed.

Parent issue:

- `#345` M21 self-managed milestone execution loop (OPEN)

Child issues:

- `#346` CLOSED via PR `#354`
- `#347` CLOSED via PR `#355`
- `#348` CLOSED via PR `#356`
- `#349` CLOSED via PR `#357`
- `#350` CLOSED via PR `#358`
- `#351` CLOSED via PR `#359`
- `#352` CLOSED via PR `#360`
- `#353` OPEN (final source-of-truth reconciliation; must be processed last)

Delivered M21 outcomes:

- `inspect-self-managed-milestone-execution-contract`
- `run-sequential-child-closeout-flow`
- `generate-sequential-closeout-execution-package`
- `generate-self-managed-milestone-handoff`
- `simulate-self-managed-milestone-execution`
- M21 operator workflow and architecture documentation updates

M21 safety posture:

- no autonomous broad mutation
- no bulk closure
- no parent closeout before all children are closed/accounted for
- mutation execution defaults to dry-run/planning unless explicitly approved
- every child is executed with dedicated branch, PR, validation, evidence comment, and targeted closeout
- final reconciliation kept last and docs-focused
- prior milestones are not mutated

M21 standard validation bundle:

- `git diff --check`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-repo-governance`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-dashboard --parent-issue 345`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-state --parent-issue 345`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-self-managed-milestone-execution-contract`
- `python -m aresforge simulate-self-managed-milestone-execution --parent-issue 345`

### M22 Candidate Themes

Replaced by active M22 implementation milestone.

### M22 - Evidence Bundle And Documentation Automation

Status: Final reconciliation in progress (`#371` only).

Parent issue:

- `#362` M22 evidence bundle and documentation automation (OPEN)

Child issues:

- `#363` CLOSED via PR `#372`
- `#364` CLOSED via PR `#373`
- `#365` CLOSED via PR `#374`
- `#366` CLOSED via PR `#375`
- `#367` CLOSED via PR `#376`
- `#368` CLOSED via PR `#377`
- `#369` CLOSED via PR `#378`
- `#370` CLOSED via PR `#379`
- `#371` OPEN (final source-of-truth reconciliation; must be processed last)

Delivered M22 outcomes:

- `inspect-evidence-bundle-automation-contract`
- `generate-child-closeout-evidence-bundle`
- `generate-parent-closeout-evidence-bundle`
- `generate-pr-evidence-bundle`
- validation summary normalization (`pass`/`fail`/`warning`/`unknown`)
- `simulate-evidence-bundle-generation`
- operator and architecture documentation updates for evidence bundle workflows

M22 safety posture:

- no autonomous broad mutation
- no bulk closure
- no parent closeout before all children are closed/accounted for
- mutation execution defaults to dry-run/planning unless explicitly approved
- every child is executed with dedicated branch, PR, validation, evidence comment, and targeted closeout
- final reconciliation kept last and docs-focused
- prior milestones are not mutated

M22 standard validation bundle:

- `git diff --check`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-repo-governance`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-dashboard --parent-issue 362`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-state --parent-issue 362`
- `python -m aresforge check-milestone-evidence-readiness --parent-issue 362`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-parent-closeout-readiness --parent-issue 362`
- `python -m aresforge generate-parent-closeout-evidence-bundle --parent-issue 362`

### M23 Candidate Themes

1. Child discovery strictness and lineage diagnostics for parent evidence bundle generation.
2. Optional advisory milestone assignment remediation reporting.
3. Parent closeout execution package with explicit audit export controls.

## Standing Boundaries

- No autonomous mutation without explicit mode selection.
- No autonomous queue workers.
- No automatic PR merge.
- No unattended background execution.
