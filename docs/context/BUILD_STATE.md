# AresForge Build State

## Current Phase

M0 — Self-Bootstrap Foundation

## Current Goal

Complete the M0 self-bootstrap foundation by validating GitHub operations, Ollama review capability, documentation agents, self-project context, Codex prompt standards, and PR validation/scoring.

## Current Source of Truth

GitHub and repository documentation are the temporary source of truth until the AresForge dashboard exists.

During M0, explicit human decisions and repository documentation take priority over AI-generated summaries or inferred automation behavior.

## Completed

- GitHub repository created: yoey2112/aresforge
- Repository cloned locally to: C:\Projects\aresforge
- Baseline document-driven structure created
- Initial self-project context docs created
- M0 milestone created: M0 — Self-Bootstrap Foundation
- Baseline GitHub labels created
- First six M0 issues created and assigned to the M0 milestone:
  - #1 Validate GitHub capability operations
  - #2 Validate Ollama GitHub operation review
  - #3 Define documentation agent model
  - #4 Create AresForge self-project context
  - #5 Create Codex prompt standard
  - #6 Define PR validation and scoring model
- Issue #1 completed:
  - PR #7 created, merged, and auto-closed issue #1
  - GitHub capability validation documented at docs/validation/GITHUB_CAPABILITY_VALIDATION.md
  - Confirmed GitHub CLI authentication scopes: gist, read:org, repo, workflow
  - Confirmed repository metadata read access
  - Confirmed label inventory read access
  - Confirmed milestone inventory read access
  - Confirmed issue read access
  - Confirmed workflow run visibility command execution
  - Confirmed branch creation, commit, push, pull request creation, pull request metadata read, PR merge, branch deletion, and issue auto-closure
- Issue #2 completed:
  - PR #9 created, merged, and auto-closed issue #2
  - Ollama GitHub operation review validation documented at docs/validation/OLLAMA_GITHUB_OPERATION_REVIEW.md
  - Confirmed local Ollama model qwen2.5:32b can review captured GitHub operation outputs
  - Confirmed Ollama can produce structured Markdown validation evidence
  - Confirmed conservative validation decisions such as NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW are useful as evidence when documented with human assessment
  - Documented limitations around empty workflow run output, milestone title encoding/mojibake, and future need for workflow-triggered local Ollama validation
- Issue #3 completed:
  - PR #10 created, merged, and auto-closed issue #3
  - Documentation agent model expanded at docs/agents/DOCUMENTATION_AGENTS.md
  - Defined documentation agent responsibilities, required inputs, required outputs, update rules, stale documentation warnings, validation evidence expectations, M0 manual flow, risks, and anti-patterns
  - Updated AGENT_CONTEXT.md with the M0 documentation agent operating model
  - Preserved the M0 constraint that documentation agent work is manual and human-reviewed

## In Progress

- Issue #4: Create AresForge self-project context
- Codex prompt standard refinement
- PR validation and scoring model definition

## Next

- Validate issue #4 documentation changes
- Open a pull request for issue #4 after validation
- Continue with issue #5: Create Codex prompt standard after issue #4 is merged

## Current Operating Constraint

All M0 changes are manually guided and manually reviewed.

No destructive automation, auto-merge, or autonomous issue closure is enabled during M0.
