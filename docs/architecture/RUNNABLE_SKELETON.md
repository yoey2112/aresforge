# Runnable Skeleton

## Purpose

Describe the implemented human-triggered operator surface through M24 canonical evidence marker workflow orchestration.

Command entrypoint:

- `python -m aresforge`

## M24 Capability Contract Alignment

- Contract authority: `docs/architecture/CANONICAL_EVIDENCE_MARKER_CONTRACT.md`.
- Canonical marker templates are deterministic and read-only by default.
- Snapshot generation and diff classification are read-only and audit-focused.
- Canonical markers are integrated into child/PR/parent evidence bundle outputs.
- Preflight parsing prefers canonical markers and preserves backward-compatible fallback parsing.
- Parent closeout remains readiness-gated and separate from marker/snapshot command execution.

## M23 Capability Contract Alignment

- Contract authority: `docs/architecture/MILESTONE_CLOSEOUT_PREFLIGHT_CONTRACT.md`.
- Parent-child lineage detection, child evidence markers, and PR mapping checks are read-only by default.
- Repair guidance output is copy/paste-safe text only and does not execute mutation.
- Orchestration command (`inspect-milestone-closeout-preflight`) provides one deterministic readiness report.
- Parent closeout remains readiness-gated and separate from preflight command execution.

## M22 Capability Contract Alignment

- Contract authority: `docs/architecture/EVIDENCE_BUNDLE_AUTOMATION_CONTRACT.md`.
- Evidence bundle generation paths are read-only by default.
- Validation summaries are normalized for deterministic evidence rendering.
- Simulation path provides fixture-friendly blocked/ready planning outputs with no mutation.
- Parent closeout remains readiness-gated and separate from generation commands.

## M21 Capability Contract Alignment

- Contract authority: `docs/architecture/M21_SELF_MANAGED_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md`.
- Parent-driven sequential child execution with final reconciliation last.
- Read-only simulation available before mutation execution.
- Targeted closeout flow accepts a single child issue only.
- Parent closeout remains readiness-gated and separate from child closeout flow.

## Automation Boundary

- human-triggered only
- read-only-safe defaults
- explicit operator approval required for execute-mode mutation
- no bulk mutation path
- no automatic PR merge
- no background jobs, polling loops, or schedulers
- parent issue remains open until children are closed/accounted and parent readiness checks pass

## Current Validation Bundle (M24)

- `git diff --check`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-repo-governance`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-dashboard --parent-issue 400`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-state --parent-issue 400`
- `python -m aresforge check-milestone-evidence-readiness --parent-issue 400`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-parent-closeout-readiness --parent-issue 400`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-milestone-closeout-preflight --parent-issue 400`
- `python -m aresforge inspect-canonical-evidence-marker-contract`
- `python -m aresforge generate-parent-closeout-marker-template --parent-issue 400`
- `python -m aresforge generate-parent-closeout-evidence-bundle --parent-issue 400`

## Known Limitations

- Parent closeout execution remains manually triggered and intentionally conservative.
- Governance milestone naming warning remains non-blocking and unresolved.
- Issue milestone assignment gaps are surfaced as warnings but do not block M24 child execution.

## Follow-Up Candidates (Post-M24)

1. Extend reconciliation evidence automation for parent closeout issue comments.
2. Add richer diff severity scoring for snapshot comparison output.
3. Add explicit stale-warning triage guidance for milestone assignment gaps.
